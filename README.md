# tictactoe-exercise-2023
After revisiting a number of concepts, I wanted to do a simple exercise. Tic Tac Toe is pretty simple and well defined, which means I can focus on the execution.
I'll iterate on it to practice other things like writing tests and applying types.

To run it, you can play it from the command line using `npm run play`. If you want to run it in the browser, run the command `npm run server`. The command `npm run build` will execute webpack and output a browser ready bundle in the `serve` folder.
